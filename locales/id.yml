        Hey! Let's get your server connected to InterChat.

        This setup will guide you through everything you need:

        📍 Select a channel for the chat

        🏠 Join or create a hub (your community space)

        ⚙️ Finish setup to start chatting

        What's a Hub? It's a shared space where servers connect and chat together. Simple as that.

        Let's get this set up and running. 🚀

        content: |
          - **Create something special:** Try naming it `#interchat`, `#global-chat`, or `#world-chat`
          - **Think about visibility:** Make sure members who want to join the fun can see this channel
          - **Room to grow:** You can always connect more channels to different communities later
          - **Keep it organized:** A dedicated channel helps keep conversations flowing smoothly
